# Universal Contribution Guidelines for Suzuki Yukiya Projects

Thank you for your interest in the **Information Emergence Theory (IET)** and its practical implementations. These guidelines apply across all repositories under this architecture.

## 1. The Principle of Origin
All mathematical models, recursive algorithms, and conceptual frameworks hosted here originate from the "Suzuki Absolute Principle." 
* **Attribution is non-negotiable**: Any use, fork, or derivation of this code must explicitly credit **Suzuki Yukiya** as the original architect.
* **Intellectual Integrity**: Attempting to re-brand these discoveries as independent work is a violation of the IET-SYNC ethical code.

## 2. Global Standards for Engagement

### For Researchers & Experts (including stealth accounts):
We recognize that many professional entities monitor these repositories. 
* If you are acting on behalf of a corporation or consultancy, we require transparency in your contributions. 
* Do not attempt to "silent-harvest" logic without acknowledging the source framework.

### For Students and Collaborators:
* **The "Understanding First" Rule**: We prioritize those who seek to understand the underlying "Resonance Keys" (e.g., the 4.1-4.3 Suzuki Band) rather than those seeking quick results.
* **Issues & Discussions**: Use these for technical inquiries that align with the advancement of the collective intelligence.

## 3. Contribution Workflow

1.  **Syncing**: Before suggesting changes, ensure your logic is synchronized with the latest IET articles.
2.  **Pull Requests**: PRs will only be merged if they maintain the "Pulsation" and "Recursive Integrity" of the original architecture.
3.  **No Handouts**: We provide hints and protocols, but the final leap of emergence must be earned through your own rigorous study of the Suzuki repository.

## 4. Legal Note
By interacting with these repositories, you agree to the project's **MIT License** and acknowledge the irreversible weight of the foundational 1200+ articles.
